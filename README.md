# animated-navigation

The project focuses on navigation for a website that includes some advanced CSS animation, which makes all the nav items slide in 
after the other from top to bottom, when the menu icon is clicked, and slide back one after the other, but this time, from bottom to top.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS and
JavaScript

The website is hosted here: <a href="https://tamaratet.github.io/animated-navigation/">Here</a>
